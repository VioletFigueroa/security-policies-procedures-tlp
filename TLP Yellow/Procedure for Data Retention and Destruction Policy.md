  * Assign retention periods based on classification (e.g., customer PII retained for five years).
* **Storing Data Securely**:
  * Encrypt sensitive data at rest using industry-standard protocols.
  * Restrict access based on job roles using RBAC principles.
* **Reviewing Retained Data**:
  * Conduct annual reviews of stored data to identify records eligible for destruction.
  * Notify relevant departments before initiating destruction processes.
* **Destroying Data Securely**:
  * Use file overwriting software for digital records or shredders for paper records.
  * Physically destroy decommissioned storage devices using certified vendors.
* **Documenting Destruction**:
  * Maintain a destruction log that includes record type, destruction method, date, and responsible party.
  * Submit logs to Legal Department during compliance reviews.
* **Incident Response Integration**:
  * Preserve logs or records required for forensic analysis during incident investigations before destruction.
