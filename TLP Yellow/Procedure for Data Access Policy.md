# TLP Classification {#tlp-classification}

# Purpose {#purpose}

To ensure access to sensitive data and systems is restricted to authorized personnel and monitored for suspicious activity, as outlined in the Data Access Policy.

# Steps {#steps}

* Granting Access:
  * Employee submits an access request via the IT Service Portal, including justification and details of the system or data needed.
  * Data Owner reviews the request and approves or denies it based on job function and necessity.
  * IT Department assigns permissions using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) principles and enables Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
* Revoking Access:
  * HR notifies the IT Department of offboarding employees or contractors at least 24 hours in advance.
  * IT Department disables user accounts, revokes system access, and logs changes in the access management system.
* Conducting Access Audits:
  * IT Department performs quarterly reviews of user access rights.
  * Discrepancies (e.g., inactive accounts or excessive permissions) are reported to Data Owners for resolution.
* Monitoring Logs:
  * Security Analysts review access logs weekly using automated tools (e.g., SIEM).
  * Investigate anomalies such as unauthorized after-hours logins or repeated failed login attempts.
* Incident Response Activation:
  * If unauthorized access is detected, escalate to the Incident Response Manager (IRM) and activate the Incident Response Playbook.
